# DreamCanvas
This project is a full-stack AI image generator built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It leverages the OpenAI API to generate custom images based on user inputs. The application utilizes Cloudinary for efficient image storage and management, and includes integration with third-party APIs for seamless data handling.
